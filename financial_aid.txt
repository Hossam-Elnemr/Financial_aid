  Finally, submit your application.
  After you submit your application, it will take up to two weeks to review your application.
  You can see course materials for free while you are waiting for your application to be approved by using the "audit mode".
If your application is approved, you'll get an email letting you know, and you'll be automatically enrolled in the course.
